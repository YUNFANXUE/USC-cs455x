DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:

WordFinder.java 
    I first input the word and get the subset of this word. I keep the subset by using ArrayList. Then I traverse all the elements in the Arraylist and input each one into the AnagramDictionary to figure out whether it is a valid word in the dictionary. If it is a valid dictionary, it will output a ArrayList which contains the valid word. For every time I input the subset word, I combine the output valid word into one ArrayList, which is "validWord" in WordFinder.java.
    After I get all the valid word for all subset word, I store the word into the class ScoreTable. For each valid word it will create a ScoreTable object. I store all the ScoreTable into an ArrayList which is "scoreList" in WordFinder.java. Then I sort the ArrayList and output the word and score.

AnagramDictionary.java 
    This class will contain a HashMap which store all the word that we read in from the dictionary. When we read the word in, it will first transfer to Multiset form, which can contain a String and a frequency array. The HashMap will let the Multiset as key, and an ArrayList as value. The value will contain all the words which have the same Multiset. So each time when we find a word's anagram word, it will find in O(1) time. So for n output, it will find all in O(n) time.

Rack.java 
    Rack.java use an ArrayList to contain all the subset.

Multiset.java
    Multiset contains a String of unique letter and an array of each letter's frequency. When initializing the object, it will use a TreeMap to find all the unique letters and it's frequency. Also I choose TreeMap because it will automatically sort the key. So I can get the string with alphebatical order. Because We need to store Multiset in AnagramDictionary, we need equals() method and hashCode() method. equals() is just basically compare the string and the array. Generating hashCode is by using the String.hashCode() add the sum of each letter's frequency.

ScoreTable.java
    ScoreTable will contain a array that store each letter's score. And a score of a particular word and a string which store the word. Because we store every valid output word into ScoreTable and we want to sort them, it also need a compareTo method.
